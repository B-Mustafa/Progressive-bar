# CSS Progressive Bar

The CSS Progressive Bar is a stylish and animated progress bar built using CSS. It allows you to showcase the completion status of different skills or tasks on your web page. This README provides instructions on how to use the CSS Progressive Bar in your project.

## Features

- Animated Progress: The CSS Progressive Bar includes smooth animations that gradually fill up the bars to represent progress.
- Customizable: You can easily customize the colors, widths, and other visual aspects of the progress bars to match your project's design.
- Easy to Implement: The provided HTML structure and CSS classes make it straightforward to integrate the CSS Progressive Bar into your existing codebase.

## Usage

To use the CSS Progressive Bar, follow these steps:

1. Include the CSS file: Download the `style.css` file from the repository and link it in your HTML file's `<head>` section.

```html
<link rel="stylesheet" href="path/to/style.css">
```

2. Add HTML markup: Place the following HTML structure where you want to display the progress bars.

```html
<div class="container">
    <div class="skills">
        <h2>HTML</h2>
        <div class="bar">
            <div class="html"><span>94%</span></div>
        </div>
        <!-- Repeat the above structure for each skill -->
    </div>
</div>
```

3. Customize as needed: You can modify the HTML structure to add more skills or adjust the progress percentages.

4. Customize the appearance: Open the `style.css` file and modify the CSS properties as per your preferences. You can customize the colors, animations, bar widths, and other visual aspects using the provided CSS classes.

```css
/* Example customization */
.html {
    background: linear-gradient(to right, red, blue);
    animation: html 2s linear forwards;
}
```

5. Save your changes and preview the page in a web browser. The progress bars should now display the specified progress percentages with animated filling effects.

## Customization

You can customize various aspects of the CSS Progressive Bar to suit your project's requirements:

- **Colors**: Modify the gradient colors for each skill's progress bar by adjusting the `background` property within the corresponding CSS class (`html`, `css`, `js`, `next`, `python`).

- **Animations**: Change the animation duration, easing, or other properties by editing the `animation` property within the respective keyframe rule (`@keyframes html`, `@keyframes css`, etc.).

- **Widths**: Adjust the width of each skill's progress bar by modifying the `width` property of the corresponding CSS class (`html`, `css`, `js`, `next`, `python`).

Feel free to experiment with different values and properties to achieve your desired visual effect.
